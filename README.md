# 💳 3D Credit Card UI – Interactive Card Form

A smooth and interactive 3D credit card component built with **HTML, TailwindCSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** 🚀

This project simulates a real credit card experience where the card updates live as the user types — and even flips to the back when entering the CVV 🔄✨

---

✨ Real-time card number formatting (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX)
✨ Live card holder name update
✨ Expiration date auto formatting (MM/YY)
✨ 3D flip animation when focusing on CVV
✨ Auto focus switching between inputs
✨ Clean UI with TailwindCSS

## 🎮 How It Works

* As you type the **card number**, it:

  * Automatically removes invalid characters
  * Adds dashes every 4 digits
  * Limits input to 16 digits
  * Displays it instantly on the card

* When typing the **card holder name**, it updates live on the card front.

* The **expiration date**:

  * Automatically formats as `MM/YY`
  * Only allows numeric input

* When focusing on the **CVV field**:

  * The card smoothly flips to the back 🎴

* When leaving the CVV field:

  * The card flips back to the front

All interactions are handled with clean JavaScript event listeners (`input`, `focus`, `blur`) ⚡

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to practice thinking like a real frontend developer —
not just styling things, but creating **interactive UI components** that feel alive and responsive 💙

This project helped me understand:

* How user input flows through the DOM
* How to control animation with logic
* How to separate behavior (JS) from styling (CSS)
